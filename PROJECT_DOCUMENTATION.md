# NFT Marketplace Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace built on the Internet Computer (IC) blockchain. It allows users to mint, buy, sell, and trade NFTs in a secure and decentralized environment.

## Core Technologies

### 1. Frontend Technologies
- **React.js**: Main frontend framework for building the user interface
- **Material-UI**: Component library for consistent and modern UI design
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with modern features like CSS variables and flexbox/grid layouts
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Core programming language for frontend logic

### 2. Backend Technologies
- **Internet Computer (IC)**: Blockchain platform for decentralized application hosting
- **Motoko**: Programming language for IC smart contracts
- **Candid**: Interface description language for IC canisters
- **Rust**: Alternative language for IC canister development

### 3. Blockchain Integration
- **Internet Computer Protocol**: For decentralized storage and computation
- **ICP Ledger**: For handling transactions and token management
- **Canister Smart Contracts**: For NFT minting and marketplace logic

## Key Features

### 1. NFT Management
